* Stepping drill
  * Worked on checking our feet.  I need to practice 3rd step.  I often do not need to shift which implies I have stepped very badly 
  * Forward kick with straight punch (Unmatched arm) 
   * Roundhouse Kick (no punch) 
    * Lotus kick  outwards (followed by matches upper cut on shift) 

* 7 Guardians (2.2)
  Tai Chi - Bo (evasion of punch) - Diagonal Ma Bo 

## Afternoon
### Principles 
1. Lock along the center line
2. Be in (correct) Bo stance before applying the lock

### 63 Step applications
* Fist @ shoulder when doing forward / & downwards elbow strike. This changes shape of arm and makes  top and bottom of arm a time as a single unit

### 63 Step form
* In Ma Bo strike forward with both arms.  Hands pointing down,  leading with the "heal" of the hand. 
* Strike down with both hands.  Hands now pointing upwards. Drop as you strike. 
* Strike behind (hammer) with both hands. 
* Turn 90` [E] to the left,  without jumping upwards.  Move hands to cross infront of chest (still in fists) 
* Shift to NE,  diagonal Bo stance, strike outwards (hammer) with both hands at temple height
* Stepping  BACK  to lady stance,  move left hand under right arm @ shoulder,  (like short form "Apparent Close Up")
* Close up drawing right fist back and moving left hand forward.  
* As wrist meet,  step back I to Bo Stance?? Left hand rotates to point to down and right fist ends up at the shoulder. 
* Drop into Dragon riding stance and strike left and with right elbow. Left hand drops to elbow, right elbow subscribes an arc in front of you in order to strike the left hand. 
* Step to Dragon riding stance,  Unmatched punch,  other hand pulled back by ear.  Fist but otherwise like right hand of pluck the needle.  
* Repeat last step of  the other side.
