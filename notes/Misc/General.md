# General

## Flow

- No sharp edges
- Do not over extend
- Think a move ahead
- Curve between moves
- Slow down into curve accelerate out

## Ways to work on balance.

- Swimming dragon on one leg
- Form with eyes closed
- Stepping full -> empty ( try picking up the back leg flat rather than rolling on to the toes)
